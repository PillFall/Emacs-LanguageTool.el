v0.0.1, 2020-01-21

This emacs package creates a pipeline to working with LanguageTool
command line jar file and correct spelling errors and grammatical.

This program was based on
link:https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-langtool[mhayashi1120
Emacs-Langtool], it's intended to make a pipeline througt emacs and
parse json output, making it incompatible with the original version,
that's why this package is not forked from github.
